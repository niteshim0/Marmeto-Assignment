# Marmeto Assignment

## Description
This project showcases a tab switching layout where users can browse through different product categories - Men, Women, and Kids. Upon clicking on each category, corresponding product cards are displayed. The project emphasizes dynamic rendering of product data fetched from an API, with product badges and images dynamically generated based on the API response. Additionally, each product card includes essential information such as product title, vendor name, price, compare at price, and a calculated discount percentage. Although the "Add to Cart" button is currently a visual placeholder, it provides a comprehensive template for further development.

It is done as an assignment for Marmeto for the position of Frontend Intern.
